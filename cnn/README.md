# Usage
  Hyperparameters are tuned by NNI (Neural Network Intelligence), a free toolkit offered by Microsoft.  
  
  `cnn_model_selected.py` is used to verify the efficacy of selected features by feature selection methods we used in our paper. 
  
  `obf_cnn.py` contains the code we used to classify the obfuscated datasets. Specifically, we built a platform which can automatically edit the config files of NNI in order to train/test obfuscated datasets consecutively
